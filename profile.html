                <h2>Brief description</h2>
                Muhammad Ali was an American former heavyweight champion boxer and one of the greatest sporting figures
                of the 20th century. An Olympic gold medalist and the first fighter to capture the heavyweight title
                three times, Ali won 56 times in his 21-year professional career. Ali’s outspokenness on issues of race,
                religion and politics made him a controversial figure during his career, and the heavyweight’s quips and
                taunts were as quick as his fists. Born Cassius Clay Jr., Ali changed his name in 1964 after joining the
                Nation of Islam. Citing his religious beliefs, he refused military induction and was stripped of his
                heavyweight championship and banned from boxing for three years during the prime of his career.
                Parkinson’s syndrome severely impaired Ali’s motor skills and speech, but he remained active as a
                humanitarian and goodwill ambassador.
