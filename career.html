                <p>After starting boxing at 12 years old, Ali achieved his first major accolade by winning the gold
                    medal
                    (Light heavyweight - 175lbs) at the 1960 Summer Olympics, in Rome.
                    Shortly after, Ali made his professional debut vs Tunney Hunsacker, in which he won via a 6 round
                    decision. He would go on to compete 9 more times in the span of a year, amassing a record of 9-0 by
                    29
                    November 1961.

                </div>
                Muhammad Ali first major victory as a professional came against heavy-hitter Sonny Liston, a man who had
                been undefeated for 28 straight bouts, spanning over a period of 10 years. Ali entered the match as an
                8-1 underdog, but quickly proved to be too much for the 36 year old Liston, and the match ended in a 6th
                round stoppage in favour of the “People’s Champ”. Ali was 22 years old and had just shocked the world
                and claimed the heavyweight title in the process.
                Ali and Liston would end up fighting again 1 year and 3 months later, with the result being a 1st round
                stoppage for Ali

                </div>
                <p>On 22 April 1967, after 8 successful consecutive title defences, Ali was drafted for military service
                    in the Vietname War, which he refused. The consequences of this decision were that Ali was banned
                    from boxing for 3 years, and sentenced to 5 years in prison. When questioned about his decision, he
                    stated: “I’ve got nothing to lose by standing for my beliefs”.
                    After an appeal was made, he was able to stay out of prison, but would not compete in boxing between
                    the age of 25 and 29 years old.

                </div>
                After coming back to boxing in 1970 following his ban, Ali took little time to aim the the top of the
                division. Only 1 year after his return he challenged for the Heavyweight title, and faced one of the
                widely considered two best Heavyweights of that decade, ‘Smokin’ Joe Frazier.
                In a much anticipated match, being labelled as “The Fight of the Century”, both men fought one of the
                toughest and grittiest fights in boxing history, with Ali losing a unanimous 15-round decision. It was
                his first professional defeat.
                The pair would fight again in 1974, and 4 years removed from the ban, Ali would prevail this time in a
                competitive match.

                </div>
                <p>Immediately after avenging his loss to Joe Frazier, Ali would go on to challenge the most feared
                    boxer of the time, the Champion George Foreman, in a match that took place in Zaire, being labelled
                    “The Rumble in the Jungle” . Foreman was and still is widely considered to be one of the biggest
                    punchers in boxing history, and had knocked out Joe Frazier inside two rounds, in what seemed an
                    extremely easy match up compared to the one fought between Frazier and Ali.
                    But again, coming as a 4-1 underdog, the 32 year old Ali clinically dismantled the much bigger and
                    younger Foreman, before finishing him in the 8th round, in what is considered his greatest
                    performance ever.

                Commonly known as the “Thrilla in Manilla” represented the end of a trilogy between Ali and ‘Smokin’
                Joe Frazier. The match took place in the Phillipines and would put an end to all questions. Once
                again the match up proved to be one of the most competitive in history and was ended by Joe Frazier
                trainer Eddie Futch, when he threw the towel in round 14 not letting his fighter answer the bell.
