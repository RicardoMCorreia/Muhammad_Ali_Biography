                </div>
                <p>After starting boxing at 12 years old, Ali achieved his first major accolade by winning the gold
                    medal
                    (Light heavyweight - 175lbs) at the 1960 Summer Olympics, in Rome.
                    Shortly after, Ali made his professional debut vs Tunney Hunsacker, in which he won via a 6 round
                    decision. He would go on to compete 9 more times in the span of a year, amassing a record of 9-0 by
                    29
                    November 1961.

                    </h2>
                </div>
                Muhammad Ali first major victory as a professional came against heavy-hitter Sonny Liston, a man who had
                been undefeated for 28 straight bouts, spanning over a period of 10 years. Ali entered the match as an
                8-1 underdog, but quickly proved to be too much for the 36 year old Liston, and the match ended in a 6th
                round stoppage in favour of the “People’s Champ”. Ali was 22 years old and had just shocked the world
                and claimed the heavyweight title in the process.
                Ali and Liston would end up fighting again 1 year and 3 months later, with the result being a 1st round
                stoppage for Ali

                    <h2>Draft refusal and banning from boxing</h2>
                </div>
                <p>On 22 April 1967, after 8 successful consecutive title defences, Ali was drafted for military service
                    in the Vietname War, which he refused. The consequences of this decision were that Ali was banned
                    from boxing for 3 years, and sentenced to 5 years in prison. When questioned about his decision, he
                    stated: “I’ve got nothing to lose by standing for my beliefs”.
                    After an appeal was made, he was able to stay out of prison, but would not compete in boxing between
                    the age of 25 and 29 years old.
