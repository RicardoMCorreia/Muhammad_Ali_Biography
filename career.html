                <h2>Muhammad Ali vs Sonny Liston - 25 February 1964</h2>
                Muhammad Ali first major victory as a professional came against heavy-hitter Sonny Liston, a man who had
                been undefeated for 28 straight bouts, spanning over a period of 10 years. Ali entered the match as an
                8-1 underdog, but quickly proved to be too much for the 36 year old Liston, and the match ended in a 6th
                round stoppage in favour of the “People’s Champ”. Ali was 22 years old and had just shocked the world
                and claimed the heavyweight title in the process.
                Ali and Liston would end up fighting again 1 year and 3 months later, with the result being a 1st round
                stoppage for Ali
